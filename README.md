# Github Battle Assignment

This is an assignment I had to make as an introduction to React.JS.


# What have I learned:

This assignment covers all the basics of using React.JS.
URL routing, states, props, lifecycles and using API's.
Now this project used the GitHub API for being able to compile lists of GitHub profiles in a ranking based on programing langauge.
This allowed me to get into building and aplying my own CRUD-API as a back-end and connect them with relative ease.
Eventough this project was part of a React.JS with API's tutorial I will at somepoint try and expand it beyond the core assignment,
and I already have some ideas


# Credits:

This was part of a course in  React.JS called: React Fundamentals.
